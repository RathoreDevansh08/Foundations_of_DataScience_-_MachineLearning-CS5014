1.  The bounding box of a set S of points in R^n is the smallest axis-parallel box which contains all the points in S. Show that two sets G and B of points in R^n is separable using an axis-parallel hyperplane if and only if their bounding boxes are disjoint. (Argue the proof in detail)
2. Argue that H is a convex hull of a set S in R^n if and only if H is the intersection of all convex sets in R^n which contain S.
